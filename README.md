## Web3 Rock Paper Scissors Game

> This repository contains the code for a decentralized Rock Paper

> Scissors game built on the BSC testnet blockchain.

## Features

**Decentralized**: The game logic is executed on-chain, ensuring fairness and transparency.

**Secure**: Player actions are cryptographically verifiable, preventing cheating.

**Play-to-Earn**: Players can win tokens by winning games.

**User-Friendly**: Simple and intuitive interface for easy gameplay.

## Technologies Used

**Solidity**: Smart contract language for the game logic.

**Hardhat**: Development environment for Solidity contracts.

**React**: Frontend framework for the user interface.

**Nextjs**: Frontend framework for the user interface.

**Web3.js**: JavaScript library for interacting with the BSC testnet blockchain.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

> git clone https://github.com/isrmicha/NextJs-Web3.git

## Roadmap

Creating a roadmap for your Web3 Rock Paper Scissors game is a fantastic way to outline the development process and set clear milestones. Hereâ€™s a structured roadmap that you can follow:

Web3 Rock Paper Scissors Game Roadmap

## **Phase 1: Planning and Design**

Define Game Rules

Establish the basic rules of Rock Paper Scissors.

Decide on the betting mechanism (if any).

**User Experience (UX) Design**

Create wireframes for the game interface.

Design user flows for gameplay, wallet connection, and betting.

**Technical Specifications**

Choose the blockchain platform (e.g., BSC Testnet).

Select the development tools (e.g., Solidity, Hardhat, React).

## Phase 2: Development

**Smart Contract Development**

Write the smart contract for game logic using Solidity.

Implement functions for player actions, betting, and result determination.

**Frontend Development**

Set up the React application for the user interface.

Integrate Web3.js to connect the frontend with the BSC Testnet blockchain.

**Testing**

Conduct unit tests for smart contracts.

Perform integration tests for the frontend and backend interactions.

## Phase 3: Deployment

Deploy Smart Contracts

Deploy the smart contract to the BSC Testnet for initial testing.

Verify the contract on the blockchain explorer.

**Frontend Deployment**

Host the frontend application on a web server or decentralized hosting platform.

User Testing

Gather feedback from users to identify bugs and areas for improvement.

## Phase 4: Launch

**Mainnet Deployment**

Deploy the smart contract to the BSC mainnet.

Ensure all functionalities are working as intended.

Marketing and Community Engagement

Promote the game through social media and crypto communities.

Engage with users to build a community around the game.

Launch Event

Organize a launch event to attract players and create buzz.

## Phase 5: Post-Launch

Monitor and Maintain

Continuously monitor the game for bugs and performance issues.

Provide regular updates and improvements based on user feedback.

Feature Enhancements

Plan and implement new features (e.g., tournaments, leaderboards).

Explore partnerships with other projects for cross-promotions.

Community Building

Foster a community through forums, social media, and events.

Encourage user-generated content and feedback.

## Phase 6: ERC-20 Token $RPS

In the near future we will create a new token on the BSC mainnet with the symbol $RPS for be the main currency.

The burning system will be that every BNB bet lost on every lose game will be BURNED.

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a clear path from conception to launch and beyond for your Web3 Rock Paper Scissors game. Each phase is crucial for ensuring a successful and engaging user experience.
